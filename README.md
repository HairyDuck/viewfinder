Welcome to **Viewfinder**, your lightweight image viewer designed for simplicity and speed!

## What is Viewfinder? 🤔

Viewfinder is a minimalist image viewer built with **Electron**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows you to effortlessly open, navigate, and zoom into your images. Say goodbye to bloated software that slows you down! With Viewfinder, you can focus on what matters most—your beautiful images.

## My Story Behind Viewfinder 🌟

I created Viewfinder as a personal project to learn **Electron** while indulging my nostalgia for the classic **Windows Photo Viewer**—a simple tool they seem to be trying to phase out. I wanted to build a lightweight image viewer that does what it needs to do without being fancy or slow. Viewfinder embodies that vision: straightforward, efficient, and easy to use!

## Purpose Behind Viewfinder 🎯

The purpose of Viewfinder is to provide a straightforward and efficient way to view images without unnecessary distractions. I believe in keeping things simple, which is why our interface is clean and user-friendly. It’s perfect for photographers, designers, or anyone who loves viewing old photos.

## Features 🚀

- **Lightweight & Fast**: Quick loading times and minimal resource usage.
- **Drag and Drop Support**: Simply drag your images into the viewer for easy access.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to easily switch between images.
- **Previous & Next Navigation**: Effortlessly navigate through your image collection.
- **Mouse Wheel Zoom**: Zoom in and out with a simple scroll. (Currenly broked)
